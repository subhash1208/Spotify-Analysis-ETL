## Introduction 

Welcome to the Spotify Analysis ETL Pipeline. This project extracts data from the Spotify API, processes it to generate meaningful insights, and stores the results in an AWS data warehouse. Visualizations and insights can then be generated for deeper understanding of your listening habits.

## Installation 

### Pre-Requisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your machine:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.7+ recommended)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.13.0/)

### Steps:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-analysis-etl.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spotify-analysis-etl
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure your Spotify API credentials:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
     ```
     SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
     SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
     SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=your-redirect-uri
     ```
5. Initialize and apply the Terraform scripts:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

## Usage 
1. Define your favorite artists or playlists in the `config.json` file.
2. Run the script to gather data:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Choose to store the processed data locally or upload it to an AWS S3 bucket.
4. Generate insights and visualizations using the included notebooks.

## Project Architecture 

<img src="https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-analysis-etl/blob/master/architecture-diagram.png" width="500px">

The Terraform scripts set up the following AWS infrastructure:
- **Lambda Function**: Executes the ETL process weekly.
- **CloudWatch Alarm**: Triggers the Lambda function based on schedule or thresholds.
- **IAM Policies/Roles**: Ensures secure access to Spotify API and AWS resources.
- **S3 Bucket**: Stores the raw and processed Spotify data for further analysis.

This setup creates a scalable ETL pipeline that builds a datalake of Spotify data.
